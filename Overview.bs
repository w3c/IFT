Abstract: This specification defines two methods to incrementally transfer fonts from server to client.
          Incremental transfer allows clients to load only the portions of the font they actually need
	  which speeds up font loads and reduces data transfer needed to load the fonts. A font can
	  be loaded over multiple requests where each request incrementally adds additional data.

Introduction {#intro}
=====================

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Incremental Font Transfer (IFT) is a collection of technologies to improve the latency of remote fonts (or "web fonts") on the web. Without this technology, a browser needs to download every last byte of a font before it can render any characters using that font. IFT allows the browser to download only some of the bytes in the file, thereby decreasing the perceived latency between the time when a browser realizes it needs a font and when the necessary text can be rendered with that font.

The success of WebFonts is unevenly distributed. This specification allows WebFonts to be used where
slow networks, very large fonts, or complex subsetting requirements currently preclude their use. For
example, even using WOFF 2 [[WOFF2]], fonts for CJK languages are too large to be practical.

There are two different methods which can be used to incrementally transfer fonts.

Patch Subset {#patch-subset}
----------------------------

In the the first method, <a href="#patch-subset">Patch Subset</a> a server generates binary patches which a
client applies to a subset of the font in order to extend the coverage of that subset. The server
is stateless, it does not maintain any session data for clients between requests. Thus when a client
requests the generation of a patch from the server it has to fully describe the current subset of the
font that it has in a way which allows the server to recreate it.

Generic binary patch algorithms are used which do not need to be aware of the specifics of the font
format. Typically a server will produce a patch by generating two font subsets: one which matches what
the client currently has and one which matches the extended subset the client desires. A binary patch
is then produced between the two subsets.

Range Request {#range-request}
------------------------------

The second
method, <a href="#range-request-incxfer">Range Request</a>, has no server-side requirements other than the server should be able to respond to byte-based range requests. The browser makes range requests to the server for the specific bytes in the font file that it needs. In order to know which bytes are necessary, the browser makes one initial special request for the beginning of the file to obtain all required font tables, and then calculates glyph coverage and required byte ranges using font character-to-glyph mapping and glyph substitution / layout tables.

In order for the range request method to be as effective as possible, the font file itself should be internally arranged in a particular way, in order to decrease the number of requests the browser needs to make. Therefore, it is expected that web developers wishing to use the range request method will use font files that have had their contents already arranged optimally.

This method was modelled after video playback on the web, where seeking in a video causes the browser to send a range request to the server.

Technical Motivation: Evaluation Report {#evaluation-report}
------------------------------------------------------------

See the Progressive Font Enrichment: Evaluation Report [[PFE-report]] for the investigation which led
to this specification.

The evaluation report found that patch subset was generally more efficient in terms of overall
performance and transferred bytes than range request. However, Range Request is simpler to deploy
for many uses cases while still providing material improvments to loading performance for large fonts.

Performance Considerations and the use of Incremental Font Transfer {#performance-considerations}
--------------------------------------------------------

Using incremental transfer may not always be beneficial, depending on the characteristics of the font
and the content being rendered. This section provides non-normative guidance to help decide:

1. When incremental transfer should be utilized.
2. When used, which of the two methods should be utilized.

Incrementally loading a font has a fundemental performance tradeoff versus loading the whole font.
Simplistically, under incremental transfer less bytes may be transferred at the potential cost of
increasing the total number of network requests being made, and/or increased request processing
latency. In general incremental font transfer will be beneficial where the reduction in latency from
sending less bytes outweighs additional latency introduced by the incremental transfer method.

The first factor to consider is the language of the content being rendered. The evaluation report
contains the results of simulating incremental font transfer across three categories of languages
([[PFE-report#langtype]]). See it's conclusions [[PFE-report#conclusions]] for a discussion of the
anticipated performance of incremental font transfer across the language categories.

Next, how much of the font is expected to be needed? If it's expected that most of the font will be
needed to render the content then incremental font transfer is unlikely to be benificial. In many cases
however only part of a font is expected to be needed. For example:

* If the font contains support for several languages but a user is expected to only render content
    in a subset of those languages.
       
* If the content being rendered uses a small subset of the total characters in a font. This is
    often the case for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Emoji, and Icon fonts.

* Only a small amount of text is being rendered. For example a font that is only used for a
    headline.

An alternative to incremental transfer is to break a font into distinct subsets (typically by script)
and use the unicode range feature of @font-face to load only the subsets needed. However, this can
break rendering [[PFE-report#fail-subset]] if there are layout rules between characters in
different subsets. Incremental font transfer does not suffer from this issue as it maintains the
original font and all it's layout rules.

### Reducing the Number of Network Requests ### {#reduce-requests}

The evaluation report found that performance of incremental transfer can be improved by specutalively
requesting more codepoints than currently needed in order to reduce the need to make
future requests. See [[PFE-report#codepredict]] for a more detailed discussion.


### Deciding between Patch Subset and Range Request ### {#patchsubset-vs-rangerequest}

From a purely performance perspective patch subset is more performant than range request. There are
three main factors for this:

1. Range request requires an extra round trip on the very first load of a font to fetch the non-outline
    font data.

2. Patch subset is able to incrementally transfer all tables in the font, while range request is
    limited to only incrementally transferring glyph outline tables. In many fonts the majority of
    data is in the glyph outlines, however there are fonts that have significant amounts of data in
    the non outline tables.

3. Patch subset is able to compress incremental font data against previously loaded data from that
    font. This leads to better compression overall compared to range request.

See the evaluation report for a quantative assessment of the difference in performance of patch
subset versus range request [[PFE-report#analysis]].

The downside of using patch subset is that it requires server side processing to produce the patches,
while range request can work on any standard HTTP server that supports range requests:

*  This means that range request can be deployed easier, and in places such as CDN's where the content
    owner may not have control over the serving stack.
    
*  The server side processing required by patch subset will lead to increased processing costs (eg.
    CPU, RAM usage) per request vs range request.

Opt-In Mechanism {#opt-in}
==========================

<em>This section is general to both IFT methods.</em>

Webpage's can choose to opt-in to either patch subset or range request incremental transfer for a font
via the use of a CSS font tech keyword ([[css-fonts-4#font-tech-definitions]]) inside the
''@font-face'' block.

There are three tech keywords available:

*  <code>incremental-patch</code>: Load the font incrementally using the patch subset method.
*  <code>incremental-range</code>: Load the font incrementally using the range request method.
*  <code>incremental-auto</code>:  Load the font incrementally. The particular method to use is
    determined by <a href="#method-negotiation">Method Negotiation</a>.

<div class=example>
The use of the <code>incremental-patch</code> keyword in this CSS rule indicates to the browser they
should use the patch subset IFT method to load the font.
<pre>
@font-face {
    font-family: "MyCoolWebFont";
    src: url("MyCoolWebFont.otf") tech(incremental-patch);
}
</pre>
</div>

Note: Each individual <code>@font-face</code> block may or may not opt-in to IFT. This is due to the variety of ways fonts are used on web pages. Authors have control over which fonts they want to use this technology with, and which they do not.

Note: the use of <code>incremental-auto</code> may incur a CORS preflight request for the initial
request of method negotiation, as the initial request sets a custom header.

IFT Method Selection {#method-selection}
========================================

<em>This section is general to both IFT methods.</em>

The client selects the IFT method to utilize for a font load using the following procedure:

*  If the content has specified which method to use, such as via the <code>incremental-patch</code> or
    <code>incremental-range</code> font tech keyword (see: <a href="#opt-in">opt-in mechanism</a>),
    then that method should be used if the client supports it. If the specified method is not supported
    then the client should fallback to to loading the font non-incrementally.

*  Otherwise if the client does not know which particular IFT method(s) that the server hosting the
    font supports, such as when the <code>incremental-auto</code> font tech keyword is used, then
    <a href="#method-negotiation">method negotiation</a> should be used to determine the method.

The most recently specified method by the content takes precedence. For example if on a site the
first page specifies to use the patch subset method for a font URL, but the second page specifies
range request for the same font URL then the second page should load the font using range request.
Such cases will require the client to reset any previously stored state for that URL and start fresh
with the new method. In the case that <code>incremental-auto</code> is encountered where previously a
specific method was specified then the client can choose to continue using the previously selected
method.


IFT Method Negotiation {#method-negotiation}
--------------------------------------------

When the particular IFT method(s) that are supported by a server are not known, the client must
determine which method to use. Different clients may support different IFT methods, and different
servers may support different IFT methods, so a negotation occurs as such:

1.  The browser makes the first request to the server using the GET HTTP method ([[rfc9110#name-get]]).
     If the client prefers the <a href="#patch-incxfer">patch-subset method</a>, it sends the relevant
     [=patch request header=]. If the client prefers the range-request method, it does not send the
     header.

2.  If the server receives the patch request header and wishes to honor it, the server must reply with
     a valid <a href="#PatchResponse">patch subset response</a> which includes the
     <a href="#handling-patch-response">patch-subset magic number</a>. Otherwise, the server must
     reply with the [[RFC9110#range.requests]]
     <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-accept-ranges"><code>Accept-Ranges</code></a>
     header, if it supports HTTP Range Requests.
     
3.  If the client receives the patch-subset magic number, it commences using the patch-subset method.
     Otherwise, if the client receives the <code>Accept-Ranges: bytes</code> header, it commences
     using the range-request method. Otherwise, the whole font file is downloaded, and the current
     non-incremental loading behavior is used.

IFT Method Fallback {#fallback}
-------------------------------

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

This summarizes behaviors that result from the above method selection and negotiation sections.

If the content specifies the range request method:

<table class="data">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;
            <th>Client supports range-request method
            <th>Client does not support range-request method
    <tbody>
	<tr>
	    <th>Server supports range-request method
	    <td>Range-request method is used.
	    <td>Client falls back to non-incremental load of the full font file.
	<tr>
	    <th>Server does not support range-request method.
	    <td>Response is missing accept-ranges header. Client falls back to
	        non-incremental load of the full font file.
	    <td>Client falls back to non-incremental load of the full font file.
</table>

If the content specifies the patch subset method:

<table class="data">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;
            <th>Client supports patch-subset method

    <tbody>
	<tr>

	    <td>Patch-subset method is used.
	    <td>Client falls back to non-incremental load of the full font file.
	<tr>

	    full font file.
	    <td>Client falls back to non-incremental load of the

</table>

If the content does not specify a specific method:

<table class="data">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;
            <th>Client prefers range-request method

    <tbody>
        <tr><th>Server supports both range-request method and patch-subset method
            <td>Client makes initial request without the patch request header, and possibly with the <code>Range</code> header.

        <tr><th>Server supports neither

</table>

Patch Based Incremental Transfer {#patch-incxfer}
=================================================

Font Subset {#font-subset}
--------------------------

A subset of a font file is a modified version of the font that contains only the data needed to
render a subset of:

*  the codepoints,
*  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featuretags">opentype layout
    features</a>,
*  and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otvaroverview#terminology">design-variation space</a>.

supported by the original font.
<span class="conform client server" id="conform-font-subset">
When a subsetted font is used to render text using any combination of the subset codepoints,
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featuretags">layout features</a>,
or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otvaroverview#terminology">design-variation space</a> it must render identically to the original font. This includes rendering with
the use of any optional typographic features that a renderer may choose to use from the original font,
such as hinting instructions.
</span>

### Font Subset Definition ### {#font-subset-definition}

A font subset definition describes the minimum data (codepoints, layout features, variation axis
space) that a <a href="#font-subset">font subset</a> must possess.

Data Types {#data-types}
------------------------

This section lists all of the data types that are used to form the request and response messages
sent between the client and server.

### Encoding ### {#encoding}

All data types defined here are encoded into a byte representation for transport using CBOR
(Concise Binary Object Representation) [[!RFC8949]]. More information on how each data types
should be encoded by CBOR are given in the definition of those data types.

### Primitives ### {#primitives}

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Data Type</th><th>Description</th><th>CBOR Major Type</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Integer</td><td>An integer value range [-2<sup>63</sup>, 2<sup>63</sup> - 1] inclusive.</td>
    <td>0 or 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Float</td><td>IEEE 754 Single-Precision Float.</td><td>7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ByteString</td><td>Variable number of bytes.</td><td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>String</td><td>UTF-8 [[rfc3629]] text string.</td><td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ArrayOf&lt;Type&gt;</td><td>Array of a variable number of items of Type.</td><td>4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### ProtocolVersion ### {#protocol-version}

An Integer describing the version of this communication protocol being used by a
PatchRequest or PatchResponse. This value guides the semantics and interpretation
of the fields sent.

This field is for future expansion. There currently is only one valid value, 0.

### SparseBitSet ### {#sparsebitset}

A data structure which compactly stores a set of distinct unsigned integers. The set is represented as
a tree where each node has a fixed number of children that recursively sub-divides an interval into
equal partitions. A tree of height <i>H</i> with branching factor <i>B</i> can store set membership
for integers in the interval [0 to <i>B</i><sup><i>H</i></sup>-1] inclusive. The tree is encoded into
a ByteString for transport.

To construct the tree <i>T</i> which encodes set <i>S</i> first select the branching factor <i>B</i>
(how many children each node has). <i>B</i> can be 4, 8, 16, or 32.

Note: the encoder can use any of the possible branching factors, but it is recommended to
use 4 as that has
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/PFE-analysis/blob/main/results/set_encoding_branch_factor.md">been shown</a>
to give the smallest encodings for most sets typically encountered.

Next, determine the height, <i>H</i>, of the tree:

<i>H</i> = ceil(log<sub><i>B</i></sub>(max(<i>S</i>) + 1))

If <i>S</i> is an empty set then <i>H</i> = 1.

Next create a tree of height H where all non-leaf nodes have <i>B</i> children. Each node in the tree
has a single value composed of <i>B</i> bits. Given a node <i>p</i> which has <i>B</i> children:
<i>c<sub>0</sub></i> ... <i>c<sub><i>B</i> - 1</sub></i> and is in a tree, <i>T</i>, of height
<i>H</i>, then:

*  D(<i>n</i>) is depth of node <i>n</i>: the number of edges between
    the root node and <i>n</i>.

*  Start(<i>c<sub>i</sub></i>) is the start (inclusive) of the interval  covered by
     <i>c<sub>i</sub></i> :<br/>
     Start(<i>c<sub>i</sub></i>) =
     Start(<i>p</i>) + <i>i</i> * <i>B</i><sup><i>H</i> - D(<i>c<sub>i</sub></i>)</sup>

*  End(<i>c<sub>i</sub></i>) is the end (exclusive) of the interval  covered by
     <i>c<sub>i</sub></i> :<br/>
     End(<i>c<sub>i</sub></i>) =
     Start(<i>p</i>) + (<i>i</i> + 1) * <i>B</i><sup><i>H</i> - D(<i>c<sub>i</sub></i>)</sup>

*  Start(root node) = 0

*  The value of node <i>p</i> is a string of <i>B</i> bits. If its bits are numbered from 0 (least
    significant) to <i>B</i> - 1 (most significant) then bit <i>i</i> will be 1 if the set <i>S</i>
    contains at least one member in the interval [Start(<i>c<sub>i</sub></i>),
    End(<i>c<sub>i</sub></i>)), otherwise bit <i>i</i> will be 0.

*  If for node <i>p</i>, End(<i>p</i>) - Start(<i>p</i>) = <i>B</i>, then <i>p</i> will have no
    children.

*  An empty set is considered to have no nodes.

The tree is encoded into a bit string. When appending multiple-bit values to the bit string, bits
are added in order from least significant bit to most significant bit.

First append 2 bits which encode the branching factor:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Bits&nbsp;</th><th>Branching Factor</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>00</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>01</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td><td>8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>11</td><td>32</td></tr>
</table>

Then append the value <i>H</i> - 1 as a 5 bit unsigned integer. Next append a single 0 bit, which
is reserved for future use.

Next the nodes are encoded into the bit string by traversing the nodes of the <i>T</i> in level
order and appending the value for each non-zero node to the bit string. If all of the set values
covered by a node's interval are present within set <i>S</i>, then that node can instead be encoded
in the bit string as <i>B</i> bits all set to zero. All children of that node must not be encoded.

Lastly the bit string is converted into a ByteString by converting each consecutive group of 8 bits
into the next byte of the string.
If the number of bits in the bit string is not a multiple of 8, zero bits are appended to the
next multiple of 8.
The bit with the smallest index in the bit string is the least
significant bit in the byte and the bit with the largest index is the most significant bit.

<div class=example>
  The set {2, 33, 323} in a tree with a branching factor of 8 is encoded as the bit string:

  ```
  BitString:
  |- header |- lvl 0 |---- level 1 ----|------- level 2 -----------|
  |         |   n0   |   n1       n2   |   n3       n4       n5    |
  [ 01010000 10000100 10001000 10000000 00100000 01000000 00010000 ]

  Which then becomes the ByteString:
  [
    0b00001010,
    0b00100001,
    0b00010001,
    0b00000001,
    0b00000100,
    0b00000010,
    0b00001000
  ]
  ```

  First determine the height of the tree:

  <i>H</i> = ceil(log<sub>8</sub>(323 + 1)) = 3

  Then append

  *  branching factor = 8 = 10
  *  <i>H</i> - 1 = 2 = 00010
  *  reserved bit = 0

  Level 0:

  * root node, n<sub>0</sub> append 00100001. Bit 0 is set because there are set members in the interval
     [0, 64), and bit 5 is set due to members in the interval [320, 384).

  Level 1:

  * There will be two non-zero children corresponding to bit 0 and bit 5 in n<sub>0</sub>:
  * n<sub>1</sub> append 00010001. It is child 0 of n<sub>0</sub> and subdivides the interval
     [0, 64). Bit 0 is set since there are set members in [0, 8) and bit 4 for [32, 40).

  * n<sub>2</sub> append 00000001. It is child 5 of n<sub>0</sub> it subdivides the interval
     [320, 384). Bit 0 is set since there are set members in [320 - 328).

  Level 2:

  * n<sub>3</sub> append 00000100. Child 0 of n<sub>1</sub>, bit 2 is set for the interval [2, 3) or 2.
  * n<sub>4</sub> append 00000010. Child 4 of n<sub>1</sub>, bit 1 is set for the interval [33, 34) or 33.
  * n<sub>5</sub> append 00001000. Child 0 of n<sub>2</sub>, bit 3 is set for the interval [323, 324)
     or 323.

</div>

<div class=example>
  The set {} in a tree with a branching factor of 4 is encoded as the bit string:

  ```
  BitString:
  |- header- |
  |          |
  [ 00000000 ]

  Which then becomes the ByteString:
  [
    0b00000000,
  ]
  ```

  First determine the height of the tree. Because we are encoding an empty
  set height is:

  <i>H</i> = 1

  Then append

  *  branching factor = 2 = 00
  *  <i>H</i> - 1 = 0 = 00000
  *  reserved bit = 0

  Empty sets have no nodes, so no bytes beyond the header need to be appended.

</div>

<div class=example>
  The set {0, 1, 2, ..., 17} can be encoded with a branching factor of 4 as:

  ```
  BitString:
  |- header | l0 |- lvl 1 -| l2  |
  |         | n0 | n1 | n2 | n3  |
  [ 10010000 1100 0000 1000 1100 ]

  First determine the height of the tree:

  <i>H</i> = ceil(log<sub>4</sub>(17 + 1)) = 3

  Then append

  *  branching factor = 4 = 01
  *  <i>H</i> - 1 = 2 = 00010
  *  reserved bit = 0

  Level 0:
  *  n<sub>0</sub> append 0011. Bit 0 set for [0, 16), bit 1 set for [16, 32)

  Level 1:
  *  n<sub>1</sub> append 0000. All bits zero to indicate interval [0, 16) is fully filled.
  *  n<sub>2</sub> append 0001. Bit 0 set for [16, 20)

  Level 2:
  *  n<sub>3</sub> append 0011. Bit 0 set for value 16, bit 1 set for value 17.

### IntegerList ### {#integerlist}

A data structure which compactly represents a list of non-negative integers
from 0 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1. The list is encoded into a ByteString for transport.

There are three steps of encoding/compression: first delta, second zig-zag, and finally UIntBase128.
The final ByteString result is simply the concatenation of the individual UIntBase128
encoded bytes.

IntegerList encoding must reject an input list which contains values not in the range
0 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1. Likewise if decoding an IntegerList results in values which are not
in the range 0 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1 the list is invalid and must be rejected.

#### Delta Encoding #### {#integerlist-deltas}

Delta encoding converts a list of integers to a list of deltas between them.

A list L of n integers L<sub>i<sub>0..n-1</sub></sub> is converted into a list
of N integers D<sub>i<sub>0..n-1</sub></sub> as follows:

* D<sub>0</sub> = L<sub>0</sub>
* D<sub>i = 1..n-1</sub> = L<sub>i</sub> - L<sub>i-1<sub>

This has the effect of reducing the magnitude of the values, which reduces the number
of bytes required in the UIntBase128 encoding, below.

<div class="example">
```
// Note: unsorted
int_list = [23, 43, 12, 3, 67, 68, 69, 0]
delta_list = [23, 20, -31, -9, 64, 1, 1, -69]
```
</div>

#### Zig-Zag Encoding #### {#integerlist-zigzag}

Zig-Zag encoding reversibly converts signed integers to unsigned integers,
using the same number of bits. The entire range of values is supported.
This step is required, as the [[#integerlist-uintbase128]] step works on
unsigned integers only. The encoding maps positive integer values to even positive integers and
negative integer values to odd positive integers. Psuedo code:

```
encode(n):
  if n >= 0:
    return n * 2
  else:
    return (n * -2) - 1

decode(n) {
  if n & 1:
    return -((n + 1) / 2)
  else:
    return n / 2
```

<div class="example">
<table>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Zig-Zag Encoding</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>-1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>-2</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>-3</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>-4</td><td>7</td></tr>
</table>

zig_zag_encoded_list = [46, 40, 61, 17, 128, 2, 2, 137]
```
</div>

#### UIntBase128 Encoding #### {#integerlist-uintbase128}

UIntBase128 is a variable length encoding of unsigned integers,
suitable for values up to 2<sup>32</sup>-1. A UIntBase128 encoded number
is a sequence of bytes for which the most significant bit is set for all but
the last byte, and clear for the last byte. The number itself is base 128
encoded in the lower 7 bits of each byte. Thus, a decoding procedure for
a UIntBase128 is: start with value = 0. Consume a byte, setting value =
old value times 128 + (byte bitwise-and 127). Repeat last step until
the most significant bit of byte is false.

UIntBase128 encoding format allows a possibility of sub-optimal encoding, where e.g.
the same numerical value can be represented with variable number of bytes (utilizing
leading zeros). For example, the value 63 could be encoded as either one byte 0x3F
or two (or more) bytes: [0x80, 0x3f].
<span class="conform server client" id="conform-uintbase128-illegal">An encoder must not allow this
to happen and must produce shortest possible encoding. A decoder must reject the response/request
if it encounters a UIntBase128-encoded value with leading zeros (a value that starts with the byte
0x80), if UIntBase128-encoded sequence is longer than 5 bytes, or if a UIntBase128-encoded value
exceeds 2<sup>32</sup>-1.</span> Pseudo-code:

```
bool ReadUIntBase128( data, *result ) {
  UInt32 accum = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    UInt8 data_byte = data.getNextUInt8();

    // No leading 0's
    if (i == 0 && data_byte == 0x80) return false;

    // If any of top 7 bits are set then << 7 would overflow
    if (accum & 0xFE000000) return false;

    accum = (accum << 7) | (data_byte & 0x7F);

    // Spin until most significant bit of data byte is false
    if ((data_byte & 0x80) == 0) {
      *result = accum;
      return true;
    }
  }
  // UIntBase128 sequence exceeds 5 bytes
  return false;
}
```

### SortedIntegerList ### {#sortedintegerlist}

A data structure which compactly represents a sorted list of ascending non-negative integers
(0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1). The list is encoded into a ByteString for transport.

This is a variation on IntegerList with better compression. Sorted lists only use two steps of
encoding/compression: first deltas and then UIntBase128. The [[#integerlist-zigzag]] step is skipped.
This allows twice the range in UIntBase128, so that single bytes may be used more often.

SortedIntegerList encoding must reject an input list which contains values not in the range
0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1.
<span class="conform server client" id="conform-sorted-integer-list-rejects-illegal">
Likewise if decoding an IntegerList results in values which are not
in the range 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1 the list is invalid and must be rejected.
</span>

### RangeList ### {#rangelist}

A RangeList encodes a set of non-negative integers (0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1). The set is encoded as a
list of disjoint intervals. Each interval is represented by two integers, a
start (inclusive) and end (inclusive).

A RangeList is a list of n pairs
[min<sub>i<sub>0..n-1</sub></sub>, max<sub>i<sub>0..n-1</sub></sub>].
The list must be non-decreasing, i.e. min<sub>i=1..n-1</sub> >= max<sub>i-1<sub>.

To encode this list, we convert it to a list L of 2n integers, where
L<sub>2i</sub> = min<sub>i</sub> and L<sub>2i+1</sub> = max<sub>i</sub> for
i = 0..n-1.

L is a sorted list of integers, so [[#sortedintegerlist]] is used to encode it as a
ByteString.

<div class="example">
```
range_list = [3, 10], [13, 268]
int_list = [3, 10, 13, 268]
delta_list = [3, 7, 3, 255]
bytes = [03 07 03 81 7F]
```
</div>

### FeatureTagSet ### {#featuretagset}

A FeatureTagSet encodes a set of zero or more
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featuretags">opentype layout feature tags</a>.
Each feature tag is mapped to an integer value and then the set of mapped integers are encoded in a
[[#sortedintegerlist]]. Feature tags are mapped to integers as follows:

*  If the tag is found in [[#feature-tag-list]]:

    *  If the "Encoded As" column corresponding to the tag is "default" then the tag is skipped and
        not encoded.

    *  Else, the tag is mapped to the integer value in the "Encoded As" column.

*  Otherwise: the tag is converted to an integer by treating the tag's 4 byte string as a 4 byte
    little endian integer.

The final encoding is produced by sorting the mapped integers (exlcuding tags which are skipped)
into ascending order and then encoding the sorted list as a [[#sortedintegerlist]].

When decoding a FeatureTagSet the integer values are mapped back to the original tags by reversing
the above mapping rules.
<span class="conform server client" id="conform-feature-tag-set-defaults">Additionally all
default features in [[#feature-tag-list]] must be added to the decoded set.</span>

### AxisSpace ### {#AxisSpace}

Stores a set of intervals on one or more open type variation axes [[opentype-variations]]</a>.
Encoded as a CBOR map (major type 5). The key in each pair is an
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/fvar#variationaxisrecord">
axis tag</a>. It is encoded as a ByteString containing exactly 4 ASCII characters. The value in each
pair is an <code>ArrayOf&lt;AxisInterval&gt;</code> [[#AxisInterval]].
<span class="conform client server" id="conform-axis-space-disjoint">The list of intervals for a
each axis tag must be disjoint.</span>

### Objects ### {#objects}

Objects are data structures comprised of key and value pairs.
<span class="conform server client" id="conform-object">Objects are encoded via CBOR as maps (major
type 5)</span>. Each key and value pair is encoded as a single map entry. Keys are always unsigned
integers and are encoded using major type 0. Values are encoded using the encoding specified by the
type of the value.

All fields in an object are optional and do not need to have an associated value. Conversely when
decoding and object fields may be present which are not specified in the schema.
<span class="conform server client" id="conform-object-unrecognized-field">
The decoder must ignore without error any key and value pairs where the key is not recognized.
</span>

There are several types of object used, each type is defined by a schema in [[#schemas]]. The schema
for a type specifies for each field:

*  A human readable name for the field. For reference only, not used in the encoding.
*  A unsigned integer id for the field. This is used as the key in the encoding.
*  The type of the value stored in this field. Can be any of the types defined in [[#data-types]]
    including object types.

## Object Schemas ## {#schemas}

### CompressedSet ### {#CompressedSet}

Encodes a set of unsigned integers. The set is not ordered and does not
allow duplicates. Members of the set are encoded into either a SparseBitSet or a
RangeList. To obtain the final set the members of the sparse
bit set and the list of ranges are unioned together.

<table>
  <tr><th>ID&nbsp;</th><th>Field Name</th><th>Type</th></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td><td>sparse_bit_set</td><td>SparseBitSet (ByteString)</td></tr>

Client {#client}
----------------

### Client State ### {#client-state}

The client will need to maintain at minimum the following state for each font file being incrementally
transferred:

*  Font subset: a byte array containing the binary data for the most recent version of the subset of
    the font being incrementally transferred. For a new font this is initialized to empty byte array.
*  Original font checksum: the most recent value of
    <a href="#PatchResponse"><code>PatchResponse.original_font_checksum</code></a> received
    from the server for this font.

*  Codepoint Reordering Map: The most recent [[#codepoint-reordering]] received from the server
    for this font.

*  Codepoint Reordering Checksum: The most recent
    <a href="#PatchResponse"><code>PatchResponse.ordering_checksum</code></a>
    for this font.

*  Original Font Axis Space: the variations axis space that the original font covers. Supplied
    by <a href="#PatchResponse"><code>PatchResponse.original_axis_space</code></a>.

*  Subset Axis Space: the most recent variations axis space that the subsetted font covers. Supplied by
    <a href="#PatchResponse"><code>PatchResponse.subset_axis_space</code></a>.

Additionally, the client can optionally store:

*  Original font feature list: a list of the
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featuretags">opentype layout feature tags</a>
    that the original font has data for. This information can be used by the client to avoid sending
    unnecessary requests for features which the original font does not contain. Supplied by
    <a href="#PatchResponse"><code>PatchResponse.original_features</code></a>.

### Extending the Font Subset ### {#extend-subset}

This algorithm is used by the client to extends its font subset to cover additional codepoints,
features, and/or design-variation space. The inputs to this algorithm are:

* Font URL: a URL where the font to be extended is located.

* Fragement Identifier (optional): if the font at the font url is a collection of fonts, the fragment
    identifier ([[rfc8081#section-4.2]]) identifies a single font within the collection.

* Client State (optional): previously saved <a href="#client-state">client state</a> for the given
    font url, or null.

* Desired Subset Definition: a <a href="#font-subset-definition">description</a> of the desired
    minimum font subset.

* Fetch Algorithm: algorithm for fetching HTTP resources, such as [[fetch]]. The remainder of this
    section is desribed in terms of [[fetch#fetching]], but it is allowed to substitute whatever
    HTTP fetching algorithm the user agent supports.

The algorithm outputs:

* Client State: client state that has been updated to contain a font subset which covers at least
    the requested subset definition.

* Cache fields: HTTP cache fields [[rfc9111#name-field-definitions]] describing how client state
    can be cached, or null.

Extend font subset algorithm:

1. Compare the input font subset definition to the input client state. If the input client state
     already satisifies the font subset definition. Then return client state, and null for the
     cache fields.

2. Otherwise make an HTTP request using the input fetching algorithm:

     * The request [=request/method=] must be either "GET" or "POST".

     * The request [=request/destination=] must be "font".

     * The request CORS [=request/mode=] must be "cors".

     * The request [=request/cache mode=] should be "no-store".

     * The request URL [=url/scheme=] must be "https".

     * The request URL [=url/path=] is set to the input font URL.

     * If [=request/method=] is "POST" then, request [=request/body=] must be a single
         <a href="#PatchRequest"><code>PatchRequest</code></a> object encoded via CBOR.

     * Otherwise if [=request/method=] is "GET" then, a [=header=] with name
         <code>Font-Patch-Request</code> (the <dfn export>patch request header</dfn>)
         and whose value is a single
          <a href="#PatchRequest"><code>PatchRequest</code></a> object encoded via CBOR and then
          base64url encoding [[rfc4648]] must be added to the request's header list.

     Any request and/or url parameters which are not specified here should be set based on
     the user agent's normal handling for font requests. For example if this font load is
     from a CSS font face, then [[css-fonts-4#font-fetching-requirements]] should be followed.

     The fields of the <a href="#PatchRequest"><code>PatchRequest</code></a> object should be set
     as follows:

     *  <code>protocol_version</code>: set to 0.

     *  <code>accept_patch_format</code>: set to the list of [[#patch-formats]] that this client is
         capable of decoding. Must contain at least one format.

     *  <code>codepoints_have</code>: set to exactly the set of codepoints that the current font subset
         contains data for. If the current font subset is an empty byte array this field is left unset.
         If the client has a codepoint ordering for this font then this field should not be set.

     *  <code>codepoints_needed</code>: set to the set of codepoints that the client wants to
         add to its font subset. If the client has a codepoint ordering for this font then this
         field should not be set.

     *  <code>indices_have</code>: encodes the set of additional codepoints that the current
         font subset contains data for. The codepoint values are transformed to indices by applying
         [[#codepoint-reordering]] to each codepoint value. If the client does not have a codepoint
         ordering for this font then this field should not be set.

     *  <code>indices_needed</code>: encodes the set of codepoints that the client wants to add to its
         font subset. The codepoint values are transformed to indices by applying
         [[#codepoint-reordering]] to each codepoint value. If the client does not have a codepoint
         ordering for this font then this field should not be set.

     *  <code>features_have</code>: set to the list of
         <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featuretags">
         opentype layout feature tags</a> that the current font subset has data for. If the current
         font subset is an empty byte array this
         field is left unset. Additionally, if the current font subset has all data for features
         present in the original font then this field can be unset.

     *  <code>features_needed</code>: set to the list of feature tags that the client wants to add
         to the current font subset. Alternatively, if the client wishes to add all features from
         the original font to it's subset then this field should be unset.

     *  <code>axis_space_have</code>: set to the current value of <code>subset_axis_space</code>
         saved in the state for this font.

     *  <code>axis_space_needed</code>: set to the intervals of each variable axis in the original
         font that the client wants to add to its font subset. If the client wants an entire axis
         from the original font then that axis should not be listed.

     *  <code>ordering_checksum</code>: If either of <code>indices_have</code> or
         <code>indices_needed</code> is set then this must be set to the current value of
         <code>ordering_checksum</code> saved in the state for this font.

     *  <code>original_font_checksum</code>:
         Set to saved value for <code>original_font_checksum</code> in the state for this font. If
         there is no saved value leave this field unset.

     *  <code>base_checksum</code>:
         Set to the checksum of the font subset byte array saved in the state for this font. See:
         [[#computing-checksums]].

     *  <code>fragment_id</code>:
         If a fragment identifier was provided as an input then this field must be set to the provided
         fragment identifier, otherwise it must be left unset.


     Note: It is allowed for the client to request more codepoints then it strictly needs. For
     example, on slower connections it may be more performant to request extra codepoints if
     that is likely to prevent a future request from needing to be sent.

3. Goto [[#handling-patch-response]].

Note: POST is preferred for the HTTP method since it will not cause a CORS preflight request
and the request object is more compactly encoded. GET should only be used during
<a href="#method-negotiation">method negotiation</a>.

#### Handling PatchResponse #### {#handling-patch-response}

If a server is able to succsessfully process a <a href="#PatchRequest"><code>PatchRequest</code></a>
it will respond with HTTP [=response/status=] code 200 and the [=response/body=] of the response will
be a 4 byte magic number (0x49, 0x46, 0x54, 0x20) followed by a single
<a href="#PatchResponse"><code>PatchResponse</code></a> object encoded via CBOR. The client
should interpret and process the fields of the object as follows:

1.  If field <code>replacement</code> is set then: the byte array in this field is a binary patch
     in the format specified by <code>patch_format</code>. Apply the binary patch to a base which
     is an empty byte array. Replace the font subset in the input client state with the result of the
     patch application.

2. If field <code>patch</code> is set then:  the byte array in this field is a binary patch
    in the format specified by <code>patch_format</code>. Apply the binary patch to the font
    subset from the input client state. Replace the font subset in the input client state with the
    result of the patch application.

3. If either <code>replacement</code> or <code>patch</code> is set then:
    <a href="#computing-checksums">compute the checksum</a> of the font subset produced by the patch
    application in steps 1 or 2. If the computed checksum is not equal to <code>patched_checksum</code>
    this is a recoverable error. Follow the procedure in [[#client-side-checksum-mismatch]]. Otherwise
    update the original font checksum in the input client state with the value in
    <code>original_font_checksum</code>.

4. If fields <code>codepoint_ordering</code> and <code>ordering_checksum</code> are set then update
    the codepoint ordering and checksum in the input client state with the new values specified by
    these two fields. If neither <code>replacement</code> nor <code>patch</code> are set, then the
    client should resend the request that triggered this response but use the new codepoint ordering
    provided in this response.

5. If <code>original_features</code> is set and the client has opted to save them then replace the
    original feature list in the input client state with the value from the response.

6. If <code>original_axis_space</code> is set then update the original axis space in the input client
    state with the value specified in this field.

7. If <code>subset_axis_space</code> is set then update the subset axis space in the input client
    state with the value specified in this field.

After processing the response, return the updated input client state and any cache headers that were
set on the response.

#### Handling Invalid Response from the Server #### {#invalid-server-response}


If the response a client receives from the server has a [=response/status=] code other than 200:

*  If it is a redirect [=status=]: follow normal redirect handling, such as
     [[fetch#http-redirect-fetch]] and then go back to [[#handling-patch-response]].

*  All other statuses, the font subset extension has failed. Follow [[#font-load-failed]].

If the response the client receives has a [=response/status=] code of 200, but the [=response/body=]
is malformed. That is, it is missing the magic number, not decodable with CBOR, or the
<a href="#PatchResponse"><code>PatchResponse</code></a> is not well formed:

*  This is an error. Follow [[#font-load-failed]].

#### Client Side Checksum Mismatch #### {#client-side-checksum-mismatch}

If the checksum of the font subset computed by the client does not match the
<code>patched_checksum</code> in the server's response then the client should:

1. Discard the input client state for this font.

2. <a href="#extend-subset">Resend the request</a>. Set the <code>codepoints_needed</code> field
    to the union of the codepoints in the discarded font subset and the set of code points
    that the previous request was trying to add.

    If the resent request also results in a checksum mismatch then this is an error. The client
    must not resend the request again and should follow [[#font-load-failed]]

#### Font Load Failed #### {#font-load-failed}

If the font load or extension has failed the client should choose one of the following options:

1.  If the client has a saved font subset, it may choose to use that and then use the user
      agent's existing font fallback mechanism for codepoints not covered by the subset.

2.  The client may re-issue the request as a regular non incremental font fetch to the same
      [=url/path=]. It must not include the patch subset request parameter. This will load
      the entire original font.

3.  Discard the saved font subset, and use the user agent's existing font fallback mechanism.

Regardless of which of the above options are used, the saved client state for this font must be
discarded.

### Load a Font in a User Agent with a HTTP Cache ### {#load-a-font}

The previous section [[#extend-subset]] provides no guidance on how a user agent should handle
saving client state between invocations of the subset extension algorithm. This section provides an
algorithm that user agents which implement [[fetch]] should use to save client state to the user
agent's HTTP cache ([[RFC9111]]).

The inputs to this algorithm:

*  Font URL: a URL where the font to be extended is located.

*  Desired Subset Definition: a <a href="#font-subset-definition">description</a> of the desired
    minimum font subset.

The algorithm outputs:

*  A <a href="#font-subset">Font Subset</a> which covers at minimum the input subset definition.

The algorithm:

1.  Make a HTTP fetch:

     * The request [=request/method=] is "GET".

     * The request [=request/destination=] must be "font".

     * The request CORS [=request/mode=] must be "cors".

     * The request URL [=url/scheme=] must be "https".

     * The request URL [=url/path=] is set to the input font URL.

     * The request [=request/cache mode=] is "only-if-cached".

2.  If the request is successful and the response is "fresh" ([[RFC9111#name-freshness]])
     then invoke [[#extend-subset]] with:

     *  Font url set to the input font url.

     *  Client state set to the response.

     *  Desired subset definition set to the input subset definition.

     *  Fetch algorithm set to [[fetch]].

     Once that returns go to step 4.

3.  Otherwise, invoke [[#extend-subset]] with:

     *  Font url set to the input font url.

     *  Client state set to null.

     *  Desired subset definition set to the input subset definition.

     *  Fetch algorithm set to [[fetch]].

     Once that returns go to step 4.

4.  If the returned cache fields are non-null update the cache entry for the input
     font url with the returned client state and returned cache fields.

5.  Return the font subset contained in the returned client state.


Server: Responding to a PatchRequest {#handling-patch-request}
--------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="conform server" id="conform-successful-response">If the server receives a well formed
<a href="#PatchRequest"><code>PatchRequest</code></a> over HTTPS for a font the server has and that was
populated according to the requirements in [[#extend-subset]] then it must respond with HTTP
[=response/status=] code 200.</span>
<span class="conform server" id="conform-magic-number">The first 4 bytes of the response
[=response/body=] must be set to 0x49, 0x46, 0x54, 0x20 ("IFT " encoded as ASCII) followed by a
single <a href="#PatchRequest"><code>PatchResponse</code></a> object encoded via CBOR.</span>

The [=url/path=] in the request [=request/url=] identifies the specific font that a patch is desired
for. If the request has the <code>fragment_id</code> field set and the file identified by [=url/path=]
is a collection of fonts, then <code>fragment_id</code> identifies the font within that collection
that a patch is desired for. The identified font is referred to as the 'original font' in the rest
of this section.

From the request object the server can produce two codepoint sets:

1.  Codepoints the client has: formed by the union of the codepoint sets specified by
     <code>codepoints_have</code> and <code>indices_have</code>.
     <span class="conform server" id="conform-remap-codepoints-have">The indices in
     <code>indices_have</code> must be mapped to codepoints by the application of the
     codepoint reordering with a checksum matching <code>ordering_checksum</code>.</span>

2.  Codepoints the client needs: formed by the union of the codepoint sets specified by
     <code>codepoints_needed</code> and <code>indices_needed</code>.
     <span class="conform server" id="conform-remap-codepoints-needed">The indices in
     <code>indices_needed</code> must be mapped to codepoints by the application of the
     codepoint reordering with a checksum matching <code>ordering_checksum</code>.</span>

Likewise, the server can produce two sets of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featuretags">opentype layout feature tags</a>:

1.  Feature tags the client's subset has: specified by <code>features_have</code>. If the field is
     unset this indicates the client's subset contains all features in the original font.

2.  Feature tags the client needs: specified by <code>features_needed</code>. If the field is unset
     this indicates the client wants all features in the original font.

Lastly, the server can produce two variable axis spaces:

1.  Axis space the client has: specified by <code>axis_space_have</code>. If any axes in the font are
     not specified in <code>axis_space_have</code> then for those axes add their entire interval
     from the original font.

2. Axis space the client needs: specified by <code>axis_space_needed</code>. If any axes in the font
     are not specified in <code>axis_space_needed</code> then for those axes add their entire interval
     from the original font.

<span class="conform server" id="conform-bad-reordering">
If the server does not recognize the codepoint ordering used by the client, it must respond
with a response that will cause the client to update it's codepoint ordering to one the server
will recognize via the process described in [[#handling-patch-response]] and not include any patch.
That is the <code>patch</code> and <code>replacement</code> fields must not be set.
</span>

<span class="conform server" id="conform-response-valid-patch">
Otherwise when the response is applied by the client following the process in
[[#handling-patch-response]] to a font subset with checksum <code>base_checksum</code> it must result
in an extended font subset:

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-subset">That contains data for at least the union
    of the set of codepoints needed and the sets of codepoints the client already has.</span>

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-subset-features">That contains data for at least

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-subset-axis-space">That contains a variation axis

    client needs.</span>

If the checksum of the original font computed by the procedure in [[#computing-checksums]] does not
match the checksum in <code>PatchRequest.original_font_checksum</code> or
<code>PatchRequest.original_font_checksum</code> is unset, then:

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-original-checksum">The value of

    The response must set the

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-original-axis-space">
    If the original font has variation axes, the
    response must set the <code>original_axis_space</code> field to the axis space covered by

Additionally:

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-patch-format">The format of the patch in the
    either the <code>patch</code> or <code>replace</code> fields must be one of those listed in
    <code>accept_patch_format</code></span>.

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-patched-checksum">
     If <code>patch</code> or <code>replacement</code> fields are set the value of

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-subset-axis-space-field">
    If <code>patch</code> or <code>replacement</code> fields are set and the original font has

*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-response-ignore-unrecognized-formats">
    If <code>accept_patch_format</code> contains any unrecognized patch formats the server must

Note: the server can respond with either a patch or a replacement but should try to produce a patch
where possible. Replacement's should only be used in situations where the server is unable to recreate
the client's state in order to generate a patch against it.

Note: if a patch subset service is composed of more than one server task and some subset of those
tasks are using a subsetter version which produces different binary results than the rest, there is
a risk that consecutive extend requests may result in unnecessary replacement responses. For example if
consecutive requests alternate between server backends with different subsetters, then each response
will be a replacement as the server tasks will be unable to recreate the previously generated
subset. This scenario might occur during software updates to the server tasks. To combat this
it's recommended that sticky load balancing is used which aims to send consecutive requests from the
same client to the same server task.

Possible error responses:


*  <span class="conform server" id="conform-reject-malformed-request">
     If the request is malformed the server must instead respond with http [=response/status=] code 400
     to indicate an error.</span>

*  If the requested font is not recognized by the server it should respond with http [=response/status=]
     code 404 to indicate a not found error.

### Range Request Support ### {#range-request-support}

A patch subset support server must also support incremental transfer via [[#range-request-incxfer]].
To support range request incremental tranfser the patch subset server must support HTTP range requests
([[RFC9110#range.requests]]) against the font files it provides via patch subset.


Computing Checksums {#computing-checksums}
------------------------------------------

64 bit checksums of byte strings are computed using the
[[!fast-hash]] algorithm. A python like pseudo
code version of the algorithm is presented below:

```
# Constant values come fast hash: https://github.com/ztanml/fast-hash
SEED = 0x11743e80f437ffe6
M = 0x880355f21e6d1965

mix(value):
  value = value ^ (value >> 23)
  value = value * 0x2127599bf4325c37
  value = value ^ (value >> 47)
  return value

fast_hash(byte[] data):
  # When casting byte arrays into unsigned 64 bit integers the bytes are in little
  # endian order. That is the smallest index is the least significant byte.
  uint64 hash = SEED ^ (length(data) * M)
  for (i = 0; i <= length(data) - 8; i += 8)
    hash = (hash ^ mix((uint64) data[i:i+8])) * M

  remaining = length(data) % 8
  if not remaining:
    return mix(hash)

  uint64 last_value = (uint64) concat(data[length(data) - remaining:],
                                      [0] * (8 - remaining))
  return mix((hash ^ mix(last_value)) * M)
```

To ensure checksums are consistent across all platforms, all integers during the computation are
in little endian order.

Note: a C implementation of fast hash can be found here: [[!fast-hash]]

<div class=example>

<table>
  <tr><th>Bytes</th><th>Checksum value</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0f 7b 5a e5</td>
    <td>0xe5e0d1dc89eaa189</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>1d f4 02 5e d3 b8 43 21 3b ae de</td>
  <td>0xb31e9c70768205fb</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

Codepoint Reordering {#codepoint-reordering}
--------------------------------------------

A codepoint reordering for a font defines a function which maps unicode codepoint values from the
font to a continuous space of [0, number of codepoints in the font). This transformation is intended
to reduce the cost of representing codepoint sets.

<span class="conform server " id="conform-remap-all">A codepoint ordering is encoded into a
<code>CompressedList</code>. The list must contain all unicode codepoints that are supported by the
font.</span> The index of a particular unicode codepoint in the list is
the new value for that codepoint.

A server is free to choose any codepoint ordering, but should try to pick one that will minimize the
size of encoded codepoint sets for that font.

### Codepoint Reordering Checksum ### {#reordering-checksum}

A checksum of a codepoint reordering can be computed as follows:

```
SEED = 0x11743e80f437ffe6
M = 0x880355f21e6d1965

mix(value):
  value = value ^ (value >> 23)
  value = value * 0x2127599bf4325c37
  value = value ^ (value >> 47)
  return value

fast_hash_ordering(uint64[] ordering):
  uint64 hash = SEED ^ (length(ordering) * 8 * M)
  for i in ordering:
    hash = (hash ^ mix(ordering[i])) * M

  return mix(hash)
```

To ensure checksums are consistent across all platforms, all integers during the computation are
in little endian order.

<div class=example>

<table>
  <tr><th>Codepoint Ordering</th><th>Checksum value</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[106, 97, 105, 120, 100]</td>
    <td>0x6986dc19f4e621e</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

Patch Formats {#patch-formats}
------------------------------

The following patch formats may be used by the server to create binary diffs between a source file
and a target file:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Format</th><th>Value</th><th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VCDIFF</td><td>0</td>
    <td>
      Uses VCDIFF format [[!RFC3284]] to produce the patch.
      <span class="conform server client" id="conform-vcdiff">
      All client and server implementations must support this format.
    </span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brotli Shared Dictionary</td><td>1</td>
    <td>Uses brotli compression [[!RFC7932]] to produce the patch. The source file is used as a shared
    dictionary
    [[!Shared-Brotli]] given to the brotli compressor and decompressor.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Range Request Incremental Transfer {#range-request-incxfer}
===========================================================

Introduction to Range Request {#range-request-intro}
-----------------------------

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

The Range Request method is a very simple method of incremental transfer, and has no server-side requirements (other than the server should be able to respond to byte-based range requests). The browser simply makes range requests to the server for the specific bytes in the font file that it needs. In order to know which bytes are necessary, the browser makes one initial special request for the beginning of the file.

In order for the range request method to be as effective as possible, the font file itself should be internally arranged in a particular way, in order to decrease the number of requests the browser needs to make. Therefore, it is expected that web developers wishing to use the range request method will use font files that have had their contents already arranged optimally.

This method was modelled after video playback on the web, where seeking in a video causes the browser to send a range request to the server.

Font organization {#font-organization}
--------------------------------------

### Background ### {#font-organization-background}

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

A particular organization of font files is beneficial for improving the performance of the range-request IFT method. The range-request IFT method only works with [[!TRUETYPE]], [[!OPENTYPE]], [[!WOFF]], or [[!WOFF2]] files. All of these file formats use an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otff#organization-of-an-opentype-font"><code>sfnt</code> wrapper</a> which provides a directory of tables inside the font file. A <code>sfnt</code>-based font file is mainly composed of a collection of independent tables.

Issue: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/IFT/issues/59">Using WOFF2 files with range-request mechanism doesn't seem to be a viable option</a>

### Introduction ### {#font-organization-introduction}

The term <dfn>range-request optimized font</dfn> is used to describe a font file organized for use with the range-request IFT method. Optimizing a font for the range-request IFT method does not change the file format of the font.

Note: Because optimizing a font does not change its file format, no new additional tooling is necessary to interact with these optimized fonts. They are still valid fonts, but with a particular internal organization.

<div class=example>
The result of optimizing an OpenType font for the range-request IFT method is still a valid OpenType font. The resulting file may be larger (by byte count) than it was before optimizing it, but fewer of those bytes should be necessary for a client to download in order to render a target text.
</div>

Note: There are no <code>MUST</code>-level requirements on the organization of a [=range-request optimized font=]. Any arbitrary font file may be considered to be a [=range-request optimized font=]. However, additional optimizations should increase the performance of loading in a browser via the range-request IFT method. Font creators are encouraged to enact as many of the optimizations listed in this section as are reasonable for the fonts they create.

### Compression ### {#font-organization-compression}

Servers supporting the range-request IFT method should support compression via the <code>Content-Encoding</code> header ([[RFC9110#name-content-encoding]]), rather than having the font file itself be statically compressed.

A [=range-request optimized font=] file (the file itself) should not use any kind of compression other than [[!RFC7932]] (commonly referred to as "Brotli") compression.

If Brotli compression is used in a [=range-request optimized font=], it should use only one <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932#section-9.2">meta-block</a>.

If Brotli compression is used in a [=range-request optimized font=], its one meta-block should have the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932#section-9.2"><code>ISUNCOMPRESSED</code></a> bit set to 1.

Issue: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/IFT/issues/60">Static file compression compatibility with range-request method</a>

### Table Ordering ### {#font-organization-table-ordering}

The term <dfn>outline table</dfn> is used to describe these three tables,
which carry different types of glyph outlines:

- The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cff"><code>CFF</code></a> table
- The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cff2"><code>CFF2</code></a> table
- The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/glyf"><code>glyf</code></a> table

A [=range-request optimized font=] should have only one outline table.

No two tables in a [=range-request optimized font=] should share a tag name.


The [=outline table=] data in a [=range-request optimized font=] should lie at the end of the file.

If a <code>CFF</code> table exists, the <a href="https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/font-tech-notes/pdfs/5176.CFF.pdf">CharString</a> data should lie at the end of the <code>CFF</code> table.

If a <code>CFF2</code> table exists, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cff2#charStrings">CharString</a> data should lie at the end of the <code>CFF2</code> table.

Issue: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/IFT/issues/28">Font Collections support</a>

### Glyph Independence ### {#font-organization-glyph-independence}

Note: The goal of this section is to make every glyph independent from each other.

A [=range-request optimized font=] should not use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6glyf.html">Compound glyphs</a>.

Issue: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/IFT/issues/58">Supporting fonts with composite glyphs via range-request</a>

Note: Compound glyphs can be flattened by inlining their component glyphs to become additional contours.

A [=range-request optimized font=] should not use <a href="https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/font-tech-notes/pdfs/5176.CFF.pdf">Subroutines</a>.

Note: CFF glyph CharStrings can be flattened by inlining subroutines to become additional CharString bytes.

### Glyph Order ### {#font-organization-glyph-order}

Glyphs inside a [=range-request optimized font=] should be sorted in the file to keep glyphs often used in the same documents close together in the file.

Note: Putting the most frequently used glyphs together in the font increases the likelihood that the browser can download a contiguous sequence of necessary glyphs in a single range-request, thereby minimizing overhead.

Note: Reordering glyphs in a font is the same conceptual operation as renaming glyphs to have different glyph IDs. Therefore, this operation cannot be completed if glyph IDs must be preserved. Because glyph IDs are internal to text processing procedures and are not persisted, this requirement is not expected to be particularly burdensome.

One suggested method of sorting the glyphs in the file is by [=usage document frequency=] inside a relevant [=corpus=].

A <dfn>corpus</dfn> is defined to be a collection of documents, where a documents includes a collection of glyphs necessary to render some textual content.

Note: For a particular website, a corpus might be defined to be individual page loads of pages on that website.

The <dfn>usage document frequency</dfn> of a particular glyph inside a [=corpus=] is defined by the number of documents in the [=corpus=] which use that glyph, divided by the number of documents in the [=corpus=].

Note: This is distinct, but similar, to the number of times the glyph is used throughout the entire corpus.

The [=usage document frequency=] of the glyphs in a [=range-request optimized font=] should be decreasing throughout the font; that is, the most frequently used glyphs should have the lowest glyph IDs.

Note: Glyph ID 0 cannot be renamed in OpenType, TrueType, WOFF, and WOFF 2 fonts. All other glyphs can be renamed.

Note: Because the goal is simply to minimize overhead by placing similarly-used glyphs together, it may actually be possible to do better than ordering by simple frequency for a particular corpus. For example, some corpuses may have cliques of glyphs which have different frequencies but which nevertheless always seem to be used together.

A suggested ordering is included in <a href="#suggested-glyph-character-ordering">Appendix A</a> below.

Browser Behaviors {#browser-behaviors}
--------------------------------------

### First Request ### {#browser-behaviors-first-request}

When a browser encounters the CSS opt-in mechanism, it is instructed to use IFT to load the fonts. First, it follows the steps in the <a href="#method-selection">IFT method selection</a> section above. If those steps result in using the range-request method, the rest of this section applies.

The IFT method selection involves a single round-trip to the server, and if the range-request method is being used, the server's response starts sending the font file to the browser. The browser should start parsing the partial font data as it is being loaded from the server. The browser should not wait until the entire file has been received before parsing its contents.

There is a certain amount of data from the beginning of the font file which the browser should unconditionally download. The boundary at the end of this data is called the <dfn>range-request threshold</dfn>.

Note: The first request does not have to be a range request. If the browser expects the [=range-request threshold=] to lie within the first <code>n</code> bytes of the font, the first request may be a range request for the first <code>n</code> bytes of the font. However, a browser may instead make a non-range request, parse the data as it is being streamed from the server, and discover that it has reached the [=range-request threshold=] while data is still being streamed.

Once all the data before the [=range-request threshold=] has been loaded by the browser, the browser may either close this connection to the server, or it may choose to leave the connection open and let the font data continue loading in the background.

A browser may choose to add a <code>Range</code> header ([[RFC9110#name-range]]) to the initial request during the IFT method selection if it has reason to believe the range it requests will be large enough and it prefers to not close this connection to the server.

Note: Different browsers may choose different [=range-request thresholds=]. Some browsers may treat this threshold as occuring at the end of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otff#table-directory">sfnt tableDirectory</a>. Other browsers may treat this threshold as occurring just before any outline data, provided the outline data appears at the end of the font. Other browsers may place this threshold at the very beginning of the file, thereby treating the whole file as able to be downloaded with range-requests.

### Subsequent Requests ### {#browser-behaviors-subsequent-requests}

After all the data before the [=range-request threshold=] has been loaded by the browser, the browser will determine which additional byte ranges in the file are necessary to load. It will then issue HTTP Range Requests ([[RFC9110#range.requests]]) for at least those ranges.

Note: Browsers are encouraged to coalesce range requests for nearby areas of the file, to minimize the amount of range-request overhead required. Browsers are encouraged to inform these coalescing decisions from network configuration parameters and bandwidth / latency observations.

Note: If the font file has followed all of the organization guidelines above, all information required for laying out content and performing shaping will lie before any of the outline data in the file, and every glyph's outline will be independent from every other glyph. Therefore, the browser can treat the [=range-request threshold=] as being just before outline data begins, and once it has loaded up to that threshold, it can lay out page content. After laying out the page, downloading all the necessary outlines can be done with a collection of independent and parallel range requests. This works particularly well for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean fonts, where 90% or more of the font data is outline data.

Note: Another valid alternative is to treat the entire font as residing on an asynchronous virtual filesystem, and have the browser track which ranges of the font it ended up reading during its normal operation. The browser could then request those regions in range requests.

Server Behaviors {#server-behaviors}
------------------------------------

Servers supporting the range-request IFT method must support range requests ([[RFC9110#range.requests]]).

Servers supporting the range-request IFT method should support compression via the
<code>Content-Encoding</code> ([[RFC9110#name-content-encoding]]) header or the
<code>Transfer-Encoding</code> header ([[RFC9112#section-6.1]]), rather than having the font file
itself be statically compressed.

<h3  id="content-inference-from-character-set">Content inference from character set</h3>

IFT exposes, to the server hosting a Web font, the set of characters that the browser can already render in a given Web font, and also the set of characters that it cannot render, but wants to (for example, to render a new Web page). For details, see <a href="#extend-subset">Extending the Font Subset</a>.

The purpose of doing so is to allow the server to compute a binary patch to the existing font, adding more characters. Thus, fonts are transferred incrementally, as needed, which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/PFE-evaluation/#analysis-cjk">greatly reduces</a>> the bytes transferred and the overall network cost..

For some languages, which use a very large character set (Chinese and Japanese are examples) the vast reduction in total bytes transferred means that Web fonts become usable, including on mobile networks, for the first time.

However, for those languages, it is <em>possible</em> that individual requests might be analyzed by a rogue font server to obtain intelligence about the type of content which is being read. It is unclear how feasible this attack is, or the computational complexity required to exploit it, unless the characters being requested are very unusual.

One mitigation, which was originally introduced for reasons of networking efficiency so is likely to be implemented in practice, is to request additional, un-needed characters to dilute the ability to infer what content the user is viewing. Requesting characters which are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/PFE-evaluation/#codepredict">statistically likely to occur</a> may <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u-05ztF9MqftHbMKB_KiqeUhZKiXNFE4TRSUWFAPXsk/edit">avoid a subsequent request</a>.

(IFT mandates HTTPS, so no in-the-middle attack is possible; the trust is between the client, and the server hosting the fonts).


<h3 id="checksum-and-possible-fingerprinting">Checksums and possible fingerprinting</h3>

In the patch subset method 64 bit checksums are generated and transferred between client and server. These are used for error detection, are not persistent across browsing sessions, change frequently in the course of a single browsing session, and thus should not pose a tracking risk.

Also, browsers typically cache resources keyed by the origin domain; thus the checksums and the set of characters the client requires would only be available to that domain and the patch subset server.

<h3 id="per-origin">Per-origin restriction avoids fingerprinting</h3>

  As required by [[!css-fonts-4]],
  Web Fonts <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#web-fonts">must not be accessible
  in any other Document from the one which either is associated with the @font-face rule
  or owns the FontFaceSet.
  Other applications on the device must not be able to access Web Fonts.</a>
  This avoids information leaking across origins.

  Similarly, font palette values
  <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-palette-values">must only be available to the documents that reference it</a>.
  Using an author-defined color palette outside of the documents that reference it
  would constitute a security leak since the contents of one page
  would be able to affect other pages,
  something an attacker could use as an attack vector.

<h2 id="suggested-glyph-character-ordering">
Appendix A: Suggested glyph/character ordering</h2>

Note: This section describes ordering of characters, not glyph IDs, because the meaning of glyph IDs are not consistent across different fonts. To optimize a particular font according to the ordering listed here, the characters will have to be mapped to glyph IDs inside the font. This approach of mapping characters to glyphs for ordering purposes works particularly well for ideographic languages with large character sets.
